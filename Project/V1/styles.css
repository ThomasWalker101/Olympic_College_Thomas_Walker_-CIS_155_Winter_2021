/*M1LO8 Demonstrate the use of external style sheets (HTML, note the external style sheet must exist and contain CSS): 
This is the style sheet. 

M2LO3 Demonstrate style precedence and inheritance in CSS (CSS, this item should be specified 2 times, once where precedence 
is applied and once where inheritance is applied; see 2-3d Style Specificity and Precedence, and 2-3e Style Inheritance)
precedence and inheritance are what they sound like.  Styles have precedence within a document, you can have a broad scope 
which has low precedence and you can go all the way down to inline style which has the highest precedence. Inheritance is what it
sounds like as well. If you share a similar defining characteristic it will get a similar style if listed in the stylesheet. 

M2LO4 Demonstrate external, embedded, and inline styles (HTML, this item should be specified 2 times, once each for embedded 
and inline styles; note external was taken care of with M1LO8; see 2-3b Embedded Style Sheets, and 2-3c Inline Styles)
The document has multiple examples of these.  

M2LO5 Demonstrate contextual selectors (CSS, specify 2 times, showing two different types of contextual selectors as shown 
in Figure 2-12, Contextual Selectors, of the textbook)
Contextual selectors: A contextual selector matches when an element is an arbitrary descendent of some ancestor element 
A contextual selector is made up of 2 or more selectors separated by white space. A contextual selector may also contain 
attribute selectors.

M2LO6 Demonstrate a CSS id and a CSS class selector (CSS, specify 2 times, show a use of id and a use of class, see 2-9b 
Attribute selectors)
I used an ID to create the link to the top of the page. I used a selector several places. 

M2LO15 Apply colors using CSS (CSS, see 2-5 Working with Color in CSS)
Did this several places below.  The color system on VSC is actually really easy to work with.   */

html {background-color: rgb(211, 211, 211);}
/* M2LO12 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of page elements (CSS, these are styles that impact page elements 
rather than impacting text on the page)
CSS allows a user to change the color, shape font etc of a document.

M2LO14 Demonstrate and explain the use of progressive enhancement in CSS (CSS, see 2-6 Employing Progressive Enhancement)
Progressive enhancement allows for older browsers to be able to read the color of a page by using the older
format first.  From the book, if an older browser can't recognize HSL it will instead read the RGB first and utilize it. */

/*M2LO13 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of textual elements (CSS, these are styles that impact text that is 
rendered on the page) 
Textual would be the font below that I changed.

pseudo-element, see 2-18 Using Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements) 
attempted this here but it didn't work, i will ask you in class on Monday */
