      <p>This is V1.  So far I have created the main page listed as index.html, the about page listed as about.html
         and the style page listed as style.css  I have also used the image from my Facebook page for this page as well.  Finally, I have also created a couple of links to the facebook page that this website
         will attached to.  So far my grasp of css is basic to say the least, i have added colors and fonts and centered items but that
         is about the extent of how far I have gone.
